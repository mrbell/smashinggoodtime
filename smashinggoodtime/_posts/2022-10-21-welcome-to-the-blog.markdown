Welcome Smashing Good Time, a Flesh and Blood blog. I'm Mike, the author. I've been playing Flesh and Blood for about a year, starting just before Tales came out. Since then I've been playing as much as I can - at my LGS, online, with some friends around the proverbial Kitchen Table, and with my family (I have a wife and two boys). I'm not particularly good, but I love to play and to learn more about the game. 

I'm starting Smashing Good Time as a way to interact a bit more deeply with the game that I love to play. I find that writing helps me process my thoughts and internalize concepts, and I'm hoping this blog can help me on my path to learning and growing as a player. If anyone ever reads it and enjoys what I write, that's cool, too. 

Anyway, welcome!
