Welcome to Smashing Good Time, a Flesh and Blood blog. I'm Mike, the author. I've been playing Flesh and Blood for about a year, starting just before Tales came out. Since then I've been playing as much as I can - at my LGS, online, with some friends around the proverbial Kitchen Table, and with my family (I have a wife and two boys). I'm not particularly good, but I love to play, learn, and grow as a player. 

I'm starting Smashing Good Time as a way to interact a bit more deeply with the game that I love to play. I find that writing helps me process my thoughts and internalize concepts, and I'm hoping this blog can help me on my journey of continuous improvement. If anyone ever reads it and enjoys what I write, that's cool, too.
