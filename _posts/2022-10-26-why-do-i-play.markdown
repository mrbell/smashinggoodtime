I consider TCGs to be like 4 hobbies in one. Collecting, deck building, playing, and spectating are distinct activities and to me are fun in their own ways. All can be enjoyed solo or socially. I love gathering with friends or meeting new people to play a great game. But I also find myself thinking through challenges away from the table, and I can meaningfully engage with TCGs through deck building, organizing my collection, or testing out theories even when I don't have the opportunity to shuffle up and play. And I'm a busy guy with a family and a demanding job, so I can't always find the time to play. Having a hobby that I can engage with at different levels, in different ways fits nicely into my lifestyle. 

I'd consider myself a competitive player, though I'm competing with myself and the game at a macro level. I don't aspire to make the Pro Tour, or to be a national champ. I enjoy exploring, learning, and puzzle solving in a game and community that is continually evolving both with the release of new product and as players learn how to play with said product.

I'm a goal oriented person. I play FaB to have fun of course, but a lot of the fun of the game for me is learning and solving problems. Goals give me a way to focus my efforts and demonstrate growth. Now that I've been playing for almost exactly a year, I've been reflecting on the time I've spent with FaB so far, and what I want to get out of the next year.

My goals for year 2 are:
- Play in 45 events (I played in 38 year 1 according to GEM)
- Attend a large event e.g. a Battle Hardened or Calling (I missed out on PQ NJ with COVID)
- Write 1x per week
- Top 8 a regional competitive event, e.g. a Skirmish, PQ, or RTN

My main focus is to just play a bit more, and with the help of writing about the game, to play in a more focused way. With more reps and focus, I hope to see some results, but I'm not going to be heart broken if not. I mainly want to have fun, meet people, and learn. If wins come, that's cool, too.
