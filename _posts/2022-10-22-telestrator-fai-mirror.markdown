In preparation for an upcoming local tournament, I've decided to practice with Fai. He's arguably the best deck right now, so I'm considering whether I should sleeve him up myself, or I want to at least have a strong understanding of how he plays. I've been testing with [Daniel Rutkowski's US Nats List](https://fabtcg.com/decklists/daniel-rutkowski-fai-deck---united-states-national-championship-092322/).

In one of the many Fai mirrors I played on Talishar, I recall a hand I wasn't sure about at the time and in retrospect I think I made the wrong play. Let's run it back. 

- My hand was a 0 for 3 w/ go again (e.g. Ronin Renegade but I don't exactly remember), a blue (e.g. Soulbead Strike, again I don't remember), and two E-strikes
- I played the 0 for 3, pitched the blue into emberblade, grabbed a Phoenix Flame, then played E-strike sinking the other E-strike and choosing +2
- Scalers were online and I was running MoM
- They didn't block the first two attacks
- I broke scalers and got the mask trigger, drawing a blue for 1 power and having the Phoenix Flame in hand still
- I followed up with Phoenix Flame and the blue (getting +1 from shuko) for 16 total damage (3 + 3 + 7 + 1 + 2)

My thinking in the moment was that they probably didn't want the mask trigger to take effect while I had Scalers online, so I might draw out blocks on the E-strike for 7. Or if they didn't, I would likely be able to follow up with an additional ~4 (a 1 for 4 piching the Phoenix Flame, or a 0 for 3 and the Phoenix Flame) for 17 damage... not a bad play. Unfortunately I only drew up a card worth 2 off the mask trigger rather than 3... unlucky. Still not the best play even if I had gotten the average draw.

I think it was a mistake though. Thinking through some alternatives
	- option 1 - also cracking SS but for 18
		- 0 for 3, emberblade, fai trigger, e-strike w/ draw a card sinking the PF, break ss, e-strike for 7 sinking the drawn card for 18 total damage
	- option 2 - no SS for 16
		- 0 for 3 opener, blue into emberblade and the Fai trigger, play the PF threatening mask then finish with e-strike for 7 if they block the PF (or continue the chain if they don't)
		- This is a 16 damage exchange assuming they stop the MoM trigger, though not as obviously, and doesn't crack SS
		- Where do I get 16? It's 14 from my attack (3 + 3 + 1 + 7), but forcing an inefficient block on their end on the PF reduces the value of their hand... assuming 3 points of value per card (Fai can do better, but they're going to choose the least inefficient block), they're losing 2 value on the exchange, so I'm counting the block as 2 points in my favor above the 1 damage presented.
		- If MoM hits, I can likely push another 3-4 damage

As played, I basically got no value from my SS. Those are there mostly to fix awkward hands or otherwise should be used when I can get the most value. The 18 point turn would have effectively represented 2 damage from my boots... OK but it can be better I think. As I played it, I got no benefit but likely I might have gotten 1 point of damage. Not worth it. In retrospect, I think I should have kept Scalers online and played out the Phoenix Flame into E-strike to finish, forcing an awkaward block. 

Along this line of thinking, I really enjoyed the recent [Arsenal Pass Podcast w/ Michael Hamilton](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/arsenal-pass-ep80-math-with-michael/id1564283250?i=1000583352667) talking about FaB math. I'm trying to incorporate this kind of thinking into my deck building and gameplay decisions, and I think it's been helpful.
